Usage: ./run.sh <mode> [options]

Modes:
  live               Build the UI, then run the real engine against
                     ~/.eTape/config.toml (live OpenD feed + real venues).
                     Requires OpenD already running and logged in. Extra
                     args are passed through to the engine, e.g.:
                       ./run.sh live -no-open -log /tmp/etape.log

  demo [SEED]        Build the UI, then run the engine against its
                     built-in, self-seeding synthetic market -- a live
                     feed over a fictional universe, no OpenD or broker
                     required, no journal to pre-generate. SEED is an
                     optional PRNG seed (omit for a random seed per
                     launch). Extra args are passed through to the
                     engine, e.g.:
                       ./run.sh demo -no-open

  dev [FIXTURE]      Run the mock WS engine + Vite dev server with hot
                     reload, for UI iteration. FIXTURE selects a
                     ui/fixtures/<name>.json (default: session-basic).

Examples:
  ./run.sh live
  ./run.sh demo
  ./run.sh demo 42
  ./run.sh dev ladder-tape
