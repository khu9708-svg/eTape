# External API Dependencies

## Runtime dependencies

- **moomoo OpenD:** primary US quote, ticker, order-book, K-line, scanner, news, stock-info, quota, and moomoo execution gateway. Engine uses raw TCP framing plus protobuf at `127.0.0.1:11111`; `InitConnect` and keepalive establish session. Trade unlock stays in OpenD GUI. See [OpenD package](../engine/internal/feed/opend/README.md).
- **Alpaca:** paper/live REST and trade-update WebSocket execution, plus
  read-only asset eligibility/borrow metadata used by Stock Info. The first
  configured Alpaca adapter loads the active asset directory once at engine
  startup with `GET /v2/assets?status=active`; Stock Info then uses in-memory
  lookups for the rest of the process. Paper credentials may also provide
  daily and one-minute history; live credentials are not reused for history.
  Alpaca SIP one-minute history also supplies the Scanner's process-local
  15-session REL VOL profiles when configured; IEX and unavailable clients
  leave that column unavailable. See [adapter](../engine/internal/broker/alpaca/README.md)
  and [history provider](../engine/internal/hist/alpaca/README.md).
- **TradeZero:** live REST execution plus portfolio WebSocket events. No market-data dependency. See [adapter](../engine/internal/broker/tradezero/README.md).
- **Yahoo Finance:** unauthenticated fallback daily history plus an
  off-by-default, experimental headline supplement (`[news].yahoo_enabled`),
  plus the optional Stock Info profile metadata path
  (`[stockinfo].yahoo_metadata`, enabled by default). The profile endpoint is
  undocumented and best-effort: Country and Sector are cached daily, and
  Industry is used only when Moomoo's Industry plate is blank. It follows the
  existing `US.<ticker>` symbol convention and is never part of the quote
  path. See [news](../engine/internal/news/README.md), [history provider](../engine/internal/hist/yahoo/README.md), and [Stock Info](../engine/internal/stockinfo/README.md).

## Contract facts

- Symbols crossing OpenD use `US.<ticker>` form.
- OpenD 3203 `SnapshotBasicData.volumeRatio` remains an optional provider field at the feed boundary; the Scanner does not consume or expose it. Scanner REL VOL is calculated from live phase-cumulative Moomoo snapshot volume and a separate Alpaca SIP 1-minute profile; chart/archive history is not an input.
- OpenD 3249 `Qot_GetShortInterest` is the source for Reported Short Interest. It accepts one US security per request; eTape requests `num = 1`, uses the newest returned `timestampStr`/`sharesShort` record, validates a JavaScript-safe share count, and preserves the raw value without split adjustment. The Scanner worker only requests admitted board symbols, caches results in memory for 24 hours, runs one request at a time at least one second apart, and stays within OpenD's 30-requests-per-30-seconds limit.
- TICKER ticks drive time-and-sales and exchange-time-bucketed 10-second bars. K-line data drives one-minute and larger intraday bars. Daily history is fetched; weekly/monthly derive from daily.
- OpenD `TickerType` is preserved as an exact raw value plus a stable `Trade-Report Condition` enum at the feed boundary. The single-writer market-data core stamps independent Range-Eligible, Last-Eligible, and Volume-Eligible permissions from the US condition matrix; unknown and unsupported values fail closed while remaining visible. `typeSign` and `PushDataType` are retained as diagnostics/provenance, and delivery source never changes eligibility. The UI-hub Significant Print classifier keeps its existing transaction-category rules; Aggressor Direction remains the feed's liquidity-taking side, not participant identity.
- Cached OpenD ticker seeds are decoded and ordered chronologically before entering the same normalized tick path as live pushes. The startup seed is capped at 1,000 prints.
- Subscription and historical-K-line quotas are separate. Multiple K-line periods for one symbol share one subscription slot; code centralizes demand and quota tracking.
- Broker adapters normalize venue payloads into `exec` domain types. Risk gates and venue arming run before adapter submission.
- Historical chart/backfill requests use completed offline-NYSE-calendar horizons and persisted explored-range coverage. Scanner REL VOL is separate: for sticky-pool symbols it requests one bounded Alpaca SIP range covering exactly the prior 15 trading dates, including each day's 04:00-to-`DataClose` window. Alpaca's one-minute `now - 16m` safety cap remains in force, although Scanner requests never include the current day. Raw Scanner bars are not persisted in `bars_1m` or another table; only the compact in-memory profile survives until the ET-day cache expires.
- Focused charts combine the configured archive windows with concurrent OpenD K_1M and K_DAY cache reads in one ordered core seed and one UI snapshot. Scanner/watch warming is archive-only and cannot occupy the focused foreground slot. Alpaca fills uncovered ranges into the archive asynchronously; Yahoo is the optional daily fallback. `intraday_days` applies to focused charts and generic scanner/watch warming, not REL VOL; it and `daily_years` are plain calendar spans, including weekends and holidays, and newly archived bars appear on the next symbol open.

## Estimated LULD boundary

The DOM's Estimated LULD Band is a local, display-only approximation. It does
not use Alpaca SIP data, does not call an official LULD band endpoint, and must
not be interpreted as a Limit State, Straddle State, Trading Pause, reopening,
or order/risk signal. It consumes OpenD's normalized Last-Eligible prints and
provider-health fields plus Moomoo's previous close; feed differences around
openings, corrections, reopenings, and halts can produce different values from
the SIPs.

Tier and ETP treatment come only from the dated checked-in registry at
`engine/internal/md/luld_registry.json`. The registry records its review date,
valid-through date, provenance, and explicit multipliers. The initial snapshot
is reviewed against the [LULD Plan](https://www.luldplan.com/), Nasdaq's [Tier 1
ETP section](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ETPSection1), and the
dated Nasdaq [ETP update notice](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/TraderNews.aspx?id=ETA2026-34).
It is intentionally an allowlist: unknown or expired symbols show no band,
and there is no runtime fetch or name-based Tier 2 fallback. Moomoo's
[real-time quote fields](https://openapi.moomoo.com/moomoo-api-doc/en/quote/get-stock-quote.html)
and [security status values](https://openapi.moomoo.com/moomoo-api-doc/en/quote/quote.html)
are provider signals only.

## Research-only alternatives

Tiger, Polygon, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, FMP, Benzinga-class feeds, and direct EDGAR/press-wire ingestion were evaluated only. No production runtime depends on them. Historical research remains at `41aa9993777cab4ea59e711775094c516032ebf2^:docs/`.
