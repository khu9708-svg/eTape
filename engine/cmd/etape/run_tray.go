//go:build tray

// This file supplies the Windows release entrypoint for cmd/etape: a system-
// tray icon (no console window) instead of a plain console process.
// systray.Run owns the OS thread, so all real work (boot's full sequence,
// and reacting to menu clicks) happens in goroutines started from onReady.
// Quit is the only shutdown path in this build -- there is no OS-signal
// handling here, unlike run_default.go's signal.NotifyContext, because a
// tray-only process has no controlling terminal to send it a Ctrl-C from.
