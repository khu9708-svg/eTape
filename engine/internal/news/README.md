# News

Polls OpenD `Qot_GetSearchNews` (3263), optionally supplements it with Yahoo
headlines, normalizes related US securities, and upserts stable article IDs to
`news.item`. Active UI demand is prioritized, but a due scanner gets the next
slot after three consecutive active requests in the same 3.1-second,
10-per-30-second quota-controlled lane; publication timestamps retain
`second`/`date`/`unknown` precision. Set `[news].yahoo_enabled = true` to use
the experimental Yahoo supplement; it reuses that same symbol rotation and
does not persist articles.

Within its in-memory retention, mirror URLs with the same normalized headline,
source, symbol, and non-conflicting publication data reconcile into one
article.

News remains a polling, in-memory feed: headline/source classification provides
deterministic catalyst scores, but no persistent dedup or price/volume signal.
Test: `go test ./internal/news`.
