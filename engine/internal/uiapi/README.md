# UI API

`uiapi` owns the low-rate Wails query and non-execution mutation contract. Go
models in `models.go` are the source of truth; `go tool wails3 generate
bindings` writes the TypeScript service under `ui/src/gen/wails/.../uiapi`,
while `tygo` continues to generate the Workspace Stream contract under
`ui/src/gen/wsmsg.ts`.

`EngineService` is the registered singleton for chart-window, fills,
cycle-fills, locate eligibility/quotes/records, export queries, scanner
filters, watchlist membership, venue setup, credentials, and read-only
connection tests.
`WorkspaceService` is registered as the workspace-scoped singleton. It owns
typed catalog/document snapshots plus create, rename, delete, load, save,
open, focus, close, durable close completion, and durable-flush operations.
Native close completion is admitted only after the frontend has serialized its
live Dockview document. Stream subscriptions,
subscriptions, demands, indicators, snapshots, and updates remain on
`uihub.Server.HandleWailsStream`.

Each generated EngineService method enters `wailsruntime.Runtime`'s shared
admission gate before reading the configured store, Hub, or locate provider.
Expected validation and provider/business outcomes are typed result values;
storage, CSV, unavailable-service, and bridge failures reject the binding.
The browser bridge may retain its legacy config adapter for non-Wails server
mode, but Wails boot makes Go's WorkspaceService the catalog/document/window
authority. Business conflicts are typed blocked results; only unavailable
storage or bridge failures reject the binding. Mutating results carry a source
revision when shared state changes; scanner and watchlist Stream payloads carry
the same revision so the UI can ignore stale cross-lane updates. Credential
methods accept write-only secret material and never return it; venue setup
returns credential names only. The migrated scanner, watchlist, venue,
credential, and connection cases are not generic Stream commands. Generic
Stream configuration and execution operations remain until their Workspace or
safety prerequisites land.

Regenerate both contracts from `engine/`:

```text
go tool tygo generate
go tool wails3 generate bindings -ts -i -clean=true -d ../ui/src/gen/wails -f "-tags wails" ./cmd/etape
```

Never hand-edit files under `ui/src/gen`; run the generated-contract drift
checks after a clean regeneration and run `npm run typecheck`.
