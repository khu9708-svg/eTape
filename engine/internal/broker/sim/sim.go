// Package sim is a deterministic in-memory exec.Broker used for tests, replay,
// and (v1.5) practice mode. Fill PRICING is book-walk based (fillAgainstBook):
// a market or marketable-limit order consumes price levels on the opposite
// side of its L2 book (SetBook), size-weighted across every level consumed,
// honoring a limit price as a per-level cap; an order with too little depth
// partially fills and rests until a later SetBook completes it. Fill
// TRIGGERING is still keyed off the last-trade mark (SetMark) for Stop/
// StopLimit orders only — stopTriggered decides *whether/when* a stop
// converts to a marketable order; fillAgainstBook then decides *at what
// price* it fills, exactly like any other Market/Limit order. A market or
// marketable-limit order with no book yet for its symbol does not reject —
// it rests (same as a non-marketable limit) until a real book arrives; there
// is no "reject for lack of a mark/book" case left in this broker. Fill
// TIMING can be additionally delayed by Options.FillLatencyMs (Task 5): a
// submit->fill delay implemented as deterministic EVENT-time gating (an
// order isn't considered for fillAgainstBook until b.now() clears its
// eligibility deadline), never a wall-clock timer — see eligibleLocked. It
// imports exec, never the reverse.

// branch. Prior to Task 5 there were two separate functions here
// (attemptInitialFillLocked applied TIF and only ran once at submission;
// this one never applied TIF and ran on every later re-evaluation) because
// IOC/FOK were guaranteed to resolve — fill, partial-then-cancel, or reject —
// at that single submit-time call, so a resting IOC/FOK order could never
// reach a later caller. Task 5 breaks that guarantee: fillLatencyMs>0 can
// defer a submit-time attempt into doing nothing at all (see the gate
// below), leaving an IOC/FOK order genuinely resting until a LATER call —
// through any of the paths above — becomes its first real evaluation. So
// this single function now owns both concerns:
//
//  1. The Task 5 eligibility gate: if o is not yet eligible (see
//     eligibleLocked), return nil immediately WITHOUT calling
//     fillAgainstBook at all. This is what "the order simply rests until a
//     later SetBook/SetMark event crosses the threshold" means in code —
//     no state changes, no partial consumption of the book, nothing to undo
//     later. Because b.now() only moves forward, once this gate opens for an
//     order it never closes again for that same order.
//  2. TIF, applied unconditionally on every eligible call: this is safe for
//     every caller. A GTC/Day order (o.TIF is neither IOC nor FOK) never hits
//     either TIF branch below, so repeated eligible calls behave exactly as
//     attemptBookFillLocked always has (partial fills accumulate across
//     multiple SetBook events). An IOC/FOK order, once it reaches an
//     eligible call, is ALWAYS removed from b.orders by the end of it (full
//     fill, partial-fill-then-cancel-remainder, or reject-with-no-fill) —
//     so it can never reach this function a second time and never gets TIF
//     misapplied to an already-resolved order. This is precisely the "TIF's
//     first attempt is the first ELIGIBLE attempt" rule the plan calls for,
//     with no new state machine: eligibility + "IOC/FOK always terminate on
//     their one evaluation" together are enough.

// attemptBookFillLocked rather than the mark itself — book-walk pricing
// replaced mark-based marketable() pricing in Task 2. A triggered Stop
// converts to TypeMarket and a triggered StopLimit converts to TypeLimit
// (unchanged conversion pattern), and only THEN reaches the book walk.

// than SetBook in real feeds, and re-attempting attemptBookFillLocked

// the same displayed depth twice (bounded by LeavesQty, so not an
// overfill, but a phantom fill off stale liquidity). The book itself
// (SetBook/crossRestingOnBookLocked) is the sole crossing trigger for
// plain orders. Returns the fill events produced (empty if it stays
// resting — including the "triggered but no book yet" case: a triggered
// stop is not a special case for SubmitOrder's rest-until-book rule).
// Caller holds mu.

// Task 5: the stopTriggered comparison above is NEVER latency-gated — a stop
// converts from Stop/StopLimit to Market/Limit purely off the mark, on
// schedule, regardless of fillLatencyMs. Only the attemptBookFillLocked call
// below is gated: if the order's eligibility deadline (set at its ORIGINAL
// submission, not at trigger time) hasn't elapsed yet, it returns nil and
// the now-converted order simply rests until a later SetBook/SetMark call
