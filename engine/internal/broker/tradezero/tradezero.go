// for an already-replaced order is still perfectly valid and must not be

//
// For a domain id with multiple rows (real ambiguity), a.tzIDByDomain wins

// pickColdStartLeg resolves it via legTier (see its doc), falling back to the

// purely id-derived, state-free tie-break that still resolves correctly since
// replace suffixes are minted in strictly increasing order and never reused

// The tier check matters for a narrow but real case: ReplaceOrder's resubmit
// can be semantically rejected AFTER the old leg's cancel already confirmed

// above — but across a process restart, tzIDByDomain is empty, and both rows
// are terminal (Canceled vs Rejected), so a pure highest-suffix tie-break
