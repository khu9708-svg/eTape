# TradeZero Adapter

REST submission/query plus portfolio WebSocket normalization. TradeZero provides execution, not market data. Preserve stable client IDs and reconcile uncertain submits. Existing `testdata/README.md` defines fixture provenance. Test: `go test ./internal/broker/tradezero`.

Account polling uses TradeZero's broker-reported Day P&L.
