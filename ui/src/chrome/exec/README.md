# Execution UI

Order ticket, hotkeys, sizing, venue selection, and arm/disarm presentation.
Inputs: user intent plus account/position stores; outputs: typed wire commands.
UI never bypasses engine gates. Grouped panels resolve only their Link Group's
persisted venue; pinned panels prompt for a Link Group and cannot submit. A
paper-to-live group switch asks for confirmation, while existing orders remain
owned by their original venue and are called out until they finish. Account
panels publish panel-scoped account demand so the engine polls only displayed
paper accounts in addition to its live risk venues. The Account strip exposes
the single broker/calculated Day P&L, eTape cycle Realized P&L, source label,
and stale timestamp. Test: `npm test -- exec`.

Dollar, Cash %, Buying Power %, Shares, and Position sizing use the selected
venue's live account and position data; Cash % uses the same available cash
shown by the Account panel.

The order ticket is optional for hotkey execution. A revisioned, in-memory
`BroadcastChannel` target follows the most recently user-activated Dockview panel
across open windows and carries its owner window, panel id, link group, linked symbol,
and resolved venue. A focused window may seed its restored active panel at startup;
programmatic restores, window focus, top-bar clicks, and modals do not retarget it.
Group, symbol, venue, panel removal, and normal window close updates are coordinated,
but the target is never persisted across a full restart. The top-bar cue is read-only;
it is blocked for no target, an ungrouped panel, a missing symbol, or a missing venue.

Place, Cancel Last, and Cancel All Focused require a grouped target; focused cancels
also require its symbol. Scoped bindings pause silently in modals and editable fields,
and OS key-repeat is consumed. Kill Switch and Cancel All Everything remain available
without a target, while disarmed, and during modal/editor focus. Arming, quote/pre-check
validation, venue fallback, engine risk gates, and sounds are unchanged. Action-template
Cancel Last and Cancel All show immediate request feedback and aggregate blocked or
ambiguous outcomes; ordinary Account-panel cancellation remains unchanged.

Action Templates own the saved order recipe, hotkey, and optional Deck Button
color. `OrderConfig.hotkeyDeck` owns the normalized, non-empty ordered Deck
Rows and the global Hotkey Label Visibility preference; Settings stages both
alongside template edits and persists them together. Legacy `deck` flags
migrate into one row, then remain only as a compatibility membership
projection. Hotkeys exports carry the Deck Layout but never `activeVenue`, and
imports regenerate template ids before remapping row references. Deck Button
clicks still use the shared `fireTemplate` path with `gateArm: false`; engine
arm and risk gates remain authoritative.
