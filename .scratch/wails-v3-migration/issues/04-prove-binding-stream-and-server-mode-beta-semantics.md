# 04 — Prove binding, Stream, and server-mode beta semantics

**What to build:** Convert the exact pinned Wails beta assumptions into permanent capability checks, proving that caller identity, binding lifetime, Stream ownership and backpressure, app-wide events, generated bindings, and server testing can support eTape's accepted safety and transport contracts before dependent migration work begins.

**Blocked by:** 02 — Pin Wails and boot a packaged Main shell.

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [x] Desktop checks prove whether a binding and Stream can be associated with their owning Native Window; if binding caller identity is unavailable, the accepted opaque Stream-session capability fallback is demonstrated without trusting a JavaScript Workspace identifier.
- [x] Binding checks cover cancellation and calls still running when shutdown starts, providing evidence for an application-owned admission and in-flight gate rather than relying on Wails cleanup order.
- [x] Stream checks cover owning-window access in desktop mode, the no-window server case, ordered close on reload and window close, immutable sent-buffer ownership, bounded sends, combined queue limits, and handler lifetime.
- [x] Event checks confirm beta.11 delivery is app-wide, exercise queue saturation, and prove that targeted, high-frequency, persistence-critical, and order-critical correctness cannot depend on ordinary events.
- [x] Generated service bindings and models are produced in the committed read-only frontend contract location by the pinned generator.
- [x] Server-mode checks prove the same binding and Stream APIs needed by Playwright work without a Native Window and can use an isolated test identity registry.
- [x] Every accepted capability has a focused automated regression check and any beta caveat is documented next to its owning architectural contract.
- [ ] A locked capability mismatch leaves this ticket incomplete and is raised for design revision; generic events, localhost product transport, weakened focus checks, or experimental composition hosting are not substituted silently.

## Accepted beta.11 capability record

- Binding caller identity is available through `application.WindowKey`; the
  desktop check binds it to a real Wails Native Window named for its owning
  Workspace. `StreamConn.Window` provides the corresponding desktop owner and
  is nil in server mode; server binding/browser identities are normalized to
  the isolated test registry's windowless owner.
- The server check obtains an opaque session through the generated binding,
  validates the first Stream frame against the isolated server registry, echoes
  ordered immutable frames with `TrySend`, and revokes the capability on close.
  A mismatched Workspace label is rejected even with a valid token.
- The application-owned gate rejects new work after the first Wails shutdown
  hook, cancels admitted gate contexts, closes tracked Streams, revokes
  capabilities, and waits admitted work independently of Wails' cleanup
  bookkeeping.
  The next lifecycle ticket must wait on this gate before engine drain/store
  close.
- Beta.11's Stream implementation is the owner of its documented per-session
  and application-wide queue bounds. The repository check exercises its public
  bounded-send API and keeps a separate bounded/coalescing queue before any
  ordinary event hint is emitted. The dispatcher emits only the newest queued
  revision for each identity. Ordinary events remain app-wide hints only; no
  targeted, high-frequency, persistence-critical, or order-critical path
  depends on delivery.
